            <h1>About Wrenixa</h1>
            <p>I am an EDM producer and digital artist from the UK, and I mainly produce Melodic Dubstep, but enjoy other genres too, such as Hyperpop, Drum and Bass, and Orchestral music.</p>
            <h2>Her Journey</h2>
            <p>My musical journey began when I picked up the flute at the age of 10. I then went on the learn both piano and bass guitar, and started producing music in 2020.</p>
            <h2>Her Musical Style</h2>
            <p>My style is constantly evolving, from heavy dubstep to lush botanica, but one thing remains consistent: each song is full of emotion, and frequently reflects my feelings.</p>
            <h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
            <p>My largest project yet was my "Problematic Mindset" EP, which released in January 2025, and took six months to complete. This EP was written to help me express my emotions through music, and is also some of my best work. I have gained over 3000 followers for my digital art, and around 800 for my music across my social media platforms. I also recently held a remix competition for my song "Devoid" with 10 incredible entries. At present, I am working on a second EP for my college assignment.</p>
            <h2>Vision and Inspiration</h2>
            <p>When I began producing music back in 2020, my first inspiration was Alan Walker, but now, I am inspired by artists like ROY KNOX, Illenium, Jane Remover, Eliminate, REZZ and many more. I also take a lot of inspiration from film and game music, which can be heard in my more orchestral songs. I aim to create a welcoming and kind environment on my social media platforms, as well as my Discord server.</p>
